## Welcome to the GeoDMS, developed by [Object Vision](https://www.objectvision.nl)

The GeoDMS is our framework for modelling with (large) geographic data sets.

At our GeoDMS repository you can find the [software](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS), [documentation](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/wiki), [issues](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/discussions) related to the GeoDMS.

To learn the GeoDMS, we advice to take a look at the [GeoDMS Academy](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS_Academy/wiki)

To work with the BAG, we developed the [BAG Toolkit](https://github.com/ObjectVision/BAG-Tools/wiki).

The GeoDMS is used for modelling applications like [Land Use Modelling](https://github.com/ObjectVision/LandUseModelling/wiki) and [Accessibility Modelling](https://github.com/ObjectVision/AccessibilityModelling/wiki). Repositories with configuration examples and documentation are available and will be updated.
